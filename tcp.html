      <h2>Analysis of The Color Purple</h2>
      <p>
<br></br>
Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" has been widely banned and has had difficulties in American libraries, schools, and even prisons. The story of Celie, an African-American woman in the early 20th century who lived in the rural South, is told in the book. Readers can follow Celie's battles with domestic violence, societal oppression, and personal identity through her letters, as well as her final empowerment via love, resilience, and self-expression. The book is an important element in conversations about social justice and feminist literature because it goes deeply into issues of race, gender, sexuality, and the interplay of these experiences.

The book's use of graphic language, depictions of sexual violence, and depictions of incest and same-sex relationships are frequently cited by critics as reasons why it should be prohibited from libraries and schools. The "graphic depictions of violence and sexuality" it included, for instance, led to its challenge and removal from several districts' required reading lists. Additionally, because of its offensive material, it was banned from all Texas state prisons in 2017 (The Banned Books Project).
