      <h2>Analysis of Fahrenheit 451</h2>
      <p>
<br></br>
     
Rad Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” is a 1953 novel that is ironically set in a world where books are banned, technology is overwhelming present, human-to-human interaction is scarce, and firefighters create fires instead of putting them out (Carnegie Mellon University Libraries). The book was challenged because of the inclusion of “sex, drugs, suicide, murder, and 
abortion. Additionally, in Texas in 2007, the book was challenged by the Conroe 
Independent School District for its’ ill references to the Bible and using God’s 
name in vain. (Marshall University Libraries). The book touches on themes of 
technological advancement and media censorship. <br></br>
The novel's honest depiction of human hardships and controversial topics has been pointed out by critics as the reason it should not be read in schools or libraries.

Fahrenheit 451 is still an important piece of literature in spite of these obstacles since it tackles important topics like media censorship, technological growth, and the loss of intellectual freedom. The effects of cultural indifference, the decline of uniqueness, and censorship of free thought are highlighted by this.</pr>
