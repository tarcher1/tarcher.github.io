But what does it mean to censor a book, and why do some stories create controversy? Here, you'll find information on notable banned books and the history of book censorship.</p>
    <h2>Why Books Get Banned</h2>
    <p>Books are commonly banned when they contain strong themes, sexually explicit content, LGBTQIA+ content, religious stances, religious stances, racism, etc. However, controversy arises in doing this because this means there is a lack of freedom of expression and speech. While these bans are typically driven by a desire to protect young readers from exposure to harm and sensitive content, they also raise significant concerns regarding freedom of speech and expression. Critics argue that banning books censors diverse perspectives and prevents individuals from engaging with important, often uncomfortable, issues. The topic of discussion is around establishing a balance between securing people from potentially harmful content and supporting open communication of ideas in society.
