      <h2>Analysis of The Hate You Give's Ban</h2>
      <p>
<br></br>
     “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas has been banned or challenged by school 
districts across Texas, Missouri and South Carolina due to its’ “inappropriate 
language” (Banned Spotlight). The book tells the story of a black teenager who was 
the sole witness of the shooting of her black friend. It raises themes regarding social 
justice but was heavily criticized for its’ content regarding drugs, promoting anti-
police rhetoric, and profanity. <br></br>Books like these are extremely controversial because 
of while they may be inappropriate for young readers, others argue that these are 
the kinds of societal issues that people should be aware of and not censored. In late 
2017 when the book was pulled from shelves by Superintendent Lance Hindt due to 
its ‘pervasive vulgarity and racially-insensitive language” claiming the ban was not 
based on its’ “substantive content or the viewpoint expressed” (Banned Spotlight).</p>
